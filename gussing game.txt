🎮 Number Guessing Game in C++
📋 Description
This is a console-based number guessing game written in C++. The game allows a player to create a profile, and then play through levels of increasing difficulty. On each level, the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range and limited number of attempts. A single hint (even/odd) is allowed per game.

🧑‍💻 Features
Create a personalized player profile (name and avatar)

Score tracking system

Level-based progression with increasing difficulty

One hint per game (reveals if the number is even or odd)

Clean and simple console interface
